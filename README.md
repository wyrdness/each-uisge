## Overview

The each-uisge (pronounced "ech-ooshkya") is considered the most malevolent and dangerous of the Scottish water horses. Unlike its cousin the kelpie which inhabits freshwater rivers and lochs, the each-uisge dwells in the sea and sea lochs of the Scottish Highlands.

It appears as a beautiful horse, often white or grey, and like the kelpie possesses adhesive skin that traps anyone who touches it. Once a victim is stuck, the each-uisge plunges into the water and drowns them.

**Most horrifically**, the each-uisge then devours its victim entirely, with only the liver floating to the surface - a grisly calling card.

The creature can also shapeshift into human form (a handsome man) or sometimes into a huge bird. In human form, the each-uisge can be detected by water weeds in their hair and webbed fingers.

## Geographic Distribution

### Primary Range

Scottish Highlands, particularly western coast and islands. Inhabits sea lochs, bays, and coastal waters. Irish variant (aughisky) found in Ireland.

### Habitat Distinction

- **Each-Uisge**: Sea lochs, ocean, saltwater
- **Kelpie**: Rivers, freshwater lochs

This habitat difference is culturally significant and consistently maintained in folklore.

### Notable Locations

| Location | Region | Significance |
|----------|--------|--------------|
| Western Highland sea lochs | Scottish Highlands | Primary each-uisge habitat |
| Isle of Skye | Inner Hebrides | Rich each-uisge folklore |

## The Floating Liver

### Signature Evidence

The most distinctive and horrific feature of each-uisge folklore:

- **Complete consumption**: Each-uisge devours its victim entirely
- **Exception**: Only the liver remains
- **Evidence**: Liver floats to the surface of the sea loch
- **Calling card**: This is how communities knew an each-uisge attack occurred

**Cultural Significance**: This detail may reflect:
- Actual drowning victims found partially consumed by scavengers
- The ocean's complete claim on victims (bodies never recovered)
- Folk explanation for livers washing ashore (possibly from seal carcasses)
- Ultimate symbol of the each-uisge's deadly nature
