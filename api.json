      "summary": "The most dangerous water horse variant in Scottish Highland folklore. Inhabits sea lochs and ocean, appears as a beautiful horse, drags victims to water, drowns and devours them completely except for the liver which floats to the surface.",
      "full": "The each-uisge (pronounced 'ech-ooshkya') is considered the most malevolent and dangerous of the Scottish water horses. Unlike its cousin the kelpie which inhabits freshwater rivers and lochs, the each-uisge dwells in the sea and sea lochs of the Scottish Highlands. It appears as a beautiful horse, often white or grey, and like the kelpie possesses adhesive skin that traps anyone who touches it. Once a victim is stuck, the each-uisge plunges into the water and drowns them. Most horrifically, the each-uisge then devours its victim entirely, with only the liver floating to the surface - a grisly calling card. The creature can also shapeshift into human form (a handsome man) or sometimes into a huge bird. In human form, the each-uisge can be detected by water weeds in their hair and webbed fingers. The each-uisge is distinguished from the kelpie primarily by habitat (sea vs. freshwater) and its more extreme lethality. In Highland folklore, it represents the ultimate danger of the sea and serves as a potent warning against approaching strange horses near coastal waters."
